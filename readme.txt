Feel free to use any of my slides/pictures. Some material (6b, biovar, and tables are from other papers, would recommend finding proper source if you use)

 Throw a reference to me if you use anything, Timothy M Chappell, University of Georgia. 

There is a geneious ‘Ti plasmid’ map just roughly done with 1000 bp. I was tired of the generic Ti plasmid most people use, and doesn’t allow the option of changing specifics within operons, multiple borders, etc. Upload into your geneious program, change anything you want, export image as a static PDF, or as EMF if you want to use powerpoint objects (will test your patience).

Any galling pictures are from me and were done on different soybean genotypes with A281.

Homologous recombination is shown with EF-Tu (tufA/tufB) in Agrobacterium C58 (has 2 identical copies), but feel free to change and replace. All homogolous recombination work I have done/shown is based on Brian Kvitko’s (University of Georgia) work.

Sorry if there are any errors
